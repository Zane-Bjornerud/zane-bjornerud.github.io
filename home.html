        <h2>About The Website</h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is Zane Bjornerud, and welcome to my digital portfolio website! This website showcases my work as a Computer Scientist and highlights my skills and experience in the field. I created this website as a way to share my work with potential clients and employers and it provides a platform for people to learn more about me and what I have accomplished. This website includes information about my background, education, and it also features a portfolio of my work. Finally, there is a contact page where you can reach out to me if you have any questions or are interested in working together.</p>
