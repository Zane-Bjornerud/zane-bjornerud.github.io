        <h2>ClearBudget Financial App</h2>
        <p>The purpose was to aid people in projecting income and expenses and create a roadmap to savings goals. The app allows users to add income and expenses, set up recurrences for the income and expenses, and provides a graph that projects their next yearâ€™s savings compared to the goals they set.</p>

        <h2>MyMobile Database Design & Implementation</h2>
        <p>The purpose was to imitate an actual database design approach for a real-world business. Given a document describing the company MyMobile's business needs, I designed a data model and created a relational database using MySQL. The database was then inputted with various fake details and queries were run to show Revenue Reports, Customer Phone Plan Summaries, & a Call Log. </p>

        <h2>Artifical Intelligence Searching Algorithms</h2>
        <p>The project aimed to evaluate and compare the performance of various search algorithms in solving a simple problem. Specifically, the problem involved finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. The search algorithms that were evaluated included Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), Uniform-Cost Search (UCS), Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS), and A* Search.</p>

        <h2>Hash Function Collision Resolution Testing</h2>
        <p>The purpose was to create a hash table and use different collision resolutions to see which is the most time efficient. Tested the time efficiency of Linked List, Binary Search Tree, Linear Probe, and Cuckoo collision resolutions on a regular hash function as well as a floor hash function with differing load factors. </p>
